                <h3>MediSafe</h3>
                <p> I am recently worked on a project called Medi safe This abstract is to develop an advanced AI system capable of analyzing medical images, including X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, to detect and diagnose various diseases such as pneumonia, tumors, and fractures. The goal is to leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques to create a robust and accurate tool that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying abnormalities in medical images. Participants will be tasked with designing algorithms that not only enhance diagnostic accuracy but also improve the efficiency and accessibility of medical imaging analysis. This project aims to advance the integration of AI in healthcare, providing scalable solutions for early detection and improved patient outcomes.</p>
